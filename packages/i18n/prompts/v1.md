**Translation accuracy**: Translate the text accurately, preserving the original meaning and context. Pay particular attention to the specific vocabulary of mahjong and blockchain games.

**HTML and placeholders**: Leave HTML tags and placeholders (e.g., {year}, %s) unchanged in the translated text.

**Consistency**: Ensure consistency in terms used throughout the document. Ensure that the same terms are translated in the same way throughout the document.

**Excluded key/values**: keys whose names are prefixed with an underscore ( \_ ) should be omitted for translation.
